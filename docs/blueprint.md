# **App Name**: QueryFire

## Core Features:

- Query Input: Simple UI for entering a query.
- LLM Response: Accept query as input and retrieve output based on an LLM to make a response.
- Display Response: Present the response in a readable format.
- Handle edge cases: The LLM tool makes an informed decision whether it is able to answer a given question.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) for a trustworthy and reliable feel.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a very lightly desaturated version of the primary.
- Accent color: Green (#34A853), for contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look.
- Use simple, outline-style icons.
- A clean, single-column layout to focus on the query and response.
- Subtle loading animations while the LLM is processing the query.
